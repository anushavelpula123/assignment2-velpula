> Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. A single graph can have many different spanning trees. A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected, undirected graph is a spanning tree with a weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree. [Source-link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kruskals-minimum-spanning-tree-algorithm-greedy-algo-2/)

```
struct Edge {
    int u, v, weight;
    bool operator<(Edge const& other) {
        return weight < other.weight;
    }
};

int n;
vector<Edge> edges;

int cost = 0;
vector<int> tree_id(n);
vector<Edge> result;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    tree_id[i] = i;

sort(edges.begin(), edges.end());

for (Edge e : edges) {
    if (tree_id[e.u] != tree_id[e.v]) {
        cost += e.weight;
        result.push_back(e);

        int old_id = tree_id[e.u], new_id = tree_id[e.v];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (tree_id[i] == old_id)
                tree_id[i] = new_id;
        }
    }
